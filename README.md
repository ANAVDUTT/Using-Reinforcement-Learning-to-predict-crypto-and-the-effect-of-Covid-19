# Using-Reinforcement-Learning-to-predict-crypto-and-the-effecto-of-Covid-19
The stock market has always been a battle of potential risk and return in
order to design a profitable strategy. A lot of times these risks are taken
based on human speculation. With human speculation, there is always room
for error, which is why large financial institutions often pay a hefty sum of
money in order to gain a slight advantage over their competitors.
Reinforcement learning has the potential to change how speculation in stocks
is undertaken. For this project, RL has been used in order to predict the
crypto prices for 3 currencies, 1) Bitcoin, 2) Dogecoin and 3) Ethereum. This
compares a pioneer in crypto with Bitcoin, a “meme coin” (DOGE) that has
recently gained traction and Ethereum a coin that has been predicted to have
high upside as well as important implications for the future. The goal of the
project is to see whether RL models are able to understand the fluctuation in
the prices of these cryptos and how Covid-19 has affected investment in
cryptocurrency. We also look at, if with the use of Reinforcement Learning,
humans are able to predict the changes that may arise in the crypto market
and see how this functionality can be broadened
